**MechanizedAI**

Mechanized AI, as it's name suggests is the application of AI by mechanical means.

More concretely mechanized AI adds sensors and motion to an AI inference and
data collection engine. The sensors feed the AI with raw information. The AI
uses the information to infer whether it should collect data or provide assistance.
If data should be collected then motion is applied to sensors so to focus the
sensors on the event. If instead assistance is needed motion is used to provide
the assistance directly or indirectly as audio visual indicators of assistance
status.

Inference is one aspect of AI. Training is the other. Inference is the result of
training and is far, far, far less computationally expensive than is training. When
a computing task is computationally expensive only it will take a long time to
complete. The time needed can sometimes be offset by adding more and faster hardware
but this becomes an issue when the AI is portable. As i write this it would be very
difficult and probably boardering on impossible to train any reasonably sized
neural network on the class and volume of hardware which can be leveraged in a
human portable platform. Let's not even think about power. To train Cifar10 you will
need at minimum at 900 series Nvidia GPU. At full speed the card will consume 200
to 250 watts of power and it will need to do this at least 10 hours and in the most
extreme cases for days or even weeks.

Mechanized AI will offer an end to end solution to address training and inference.
The AI mech will infer, capture, and interact. When ready to train, the mech will
attach to a DreamBox and begin training. the AI mech is always in charge of the
training. The dreambox has no method to alter the mach AI and serve as the muscle
for training. When training is complete, the mech will upload the new models, clean up,
wake up and begin again with capture, infer, and interact functions. I hope to make
this like the apple of AI devices. It does only a few things but it does them very
well, without much help and everytime :-)

The way to get there is Mechanized AI. The embodiment of my passion for mechanized
AI is ...


<span style="font-size:larger;">**Somax**</span>


Somax is my attempt to offer personal, private, and soley owned AI to
everyone.
Somax does not share data unless you make it do so. It's primary objective
is to share no information with the likes of Google services, AWS, Azure or any
of the other personal information pirates.

Somax's secondary mission is to alert it's human to possible use of personal
information use by those same pirates.

Somax's ternary mission is to employee AI as a corporate profit counter measure.
For example, even though television travels free through the ether, it is not free.
If we don't pay up front we, pay in commercials. Way too many comercials that
plead with us to get fatter, self medicate, or spend frivolously. I'm going to teach
somax to set recordings for my favorite shows. While somax is recording he will learn
about the commercials and during playback he will automatically fast forward past
commercials. Once he knows what to look for he, will be able to do this in realtime
and need only record a buffer of data, maybe as little as a few minutes depending
on how many minutes of commercials are in the program. worst case, I could let him
record and buffer two program at the same time. When one program gets to a commercial
somax would switch to the other program. Imagine this applied to your favorite
weekend couch potato sporting passtime.

Somax has eyes and ears but no voice. This is on purpose and is meant to keep
communication private. If Somax has something to tell you, he will pop it up on
the closest approved electronic device. The device could be your phone or perhaps
a PC. Somax is intended to learn personal things about you so he can better help
assist your daily actions. The more Somax see's and hears, the more he will be able
assist. But seeing and hearing more means that sometimes iy may hear something
that should not be repeated. Good news Somax has no voice and no other means to
publically display information.

Personal AI discovers and initiates assistance much the same as a paid assistant for
a CEO. It does this in a very human, by observing what we do. What help it can give
and it's usefulness is based on what has seen and heard. Put simplt the more it sees
and hears, the better it will help. Somax is designed and coded to be responsible and
diligently protect what it sees and hears. At some point, your AI could become lost,
stolen, or fail to operate correctly. For the first two cases Somax will employ an
auto destruct sequence that will force a higher voltage (not enough to start a fire)
through it's components and fry as many as possible. it will carry this out without
saying a single word to anyone until it is complete. I would recomend that you
initiate the auto destruct sequence when you will no longer need your
mechanized AI. Remember, what it knows is very, very, very personal. When in doubt
auto destruct.

After saying the above, I would be a hypocrite for taking money for this work. If
I ever do, please corporate counter measure me! You should in the coming days have
access and rights to use all designs, source code, and support materials without
encumbrance providing they be used to do no harm. Use my works as you will BUT
DO NO HARM.

This is the initial upload please check back often as development is going to
preceed at a steady pace from this point.

enjoy,
Mark
